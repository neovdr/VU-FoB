# Biological Background

# Scripts
* output benchmark file
  - weighting function
* SCOP
  - Benchmark on superfamily instead of family
* Documentation
  - BLAST
  - GO
  - Pfam
  - SCOP
  - benchmark
  - roc plot
* check all paramters are factored out as parameters to functions
* make main.py, with commandline options
* roc plot title shoud look like: BLAST(e=0.1) Porin OmpF (GO-3)
* roc plot of random proteins

### Maybe

* quality check of benchmark (GOTerms) on random proteins

# Report

* Go trough feedback and deal with minor comments
* Fix references
* Generate ROC plots
* Discuss ROC plots
* Think of more results in the report?

# Discussion

* Rationale about benchmark (SCOP, GOTerms, Pfam, combination)
* Discussion about results
