# Biological Background

# Scripts
* BLAST on max e-value instead of max results
* filter on e-value in BLAST
* output benchmark file
  - benchmark GOterms (homologue if one functional annotation with suitable
    evidence agrees)
  - benchmark Pfam (same family)
  - weighting function

### Maybe

* quality check of benchmark (GOTerms) on random proteins

# Report

* Waiting for feedback
* Rationale for not using false negatives and true negatives

# Discussion

* Rationale about benchmark (SCOP, GOTerms, Pfam, combination)
* Discussion about results
