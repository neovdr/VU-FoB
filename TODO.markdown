# Biological Background

# Scripts
* output benchmark file
  - benchmark GOterms (homologue if n functional/process annotations with suitable
    evidence agree)
  - weighting function
* SCOP
  - Benchmark on superfamily instead of family

### Maybe

* quality check of benchmark (GOTerms) on random proteins

# Report

* Waiting for feedback

# Discussion

* Rationale about benchmark (SCOP, GOTerms, Pfam, combination)
* Discussion about results
