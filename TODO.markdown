# Biological Background

# Scripts
* output benchmark file
  - weighting function
* SCOP
  - Benchmark on superfamily instead of family

### Maybe

* quality check of benchmark (GOTerms) on random proteins

# Report

* Go trough feedback and deal with minor comments
* Fix references
* Generate ROC plots
* Discuss ROC plots
* Think of more results in the report?

# Discussion

* Rationale about benchmark (SCOP, GOTerms, Pfam, combination)
* Discussion about results
