test

=== Biological Background ===
* literature on threshold of e value BLAST

== Scripts ===
* parse blast to get a list of hits with
    - protein id
    - e-value
    - score bits
* BLAST on max e-value instead of max results
* filter on e-value in BLAST
* research what first result in BLAST means
* output benchmark file
  - benchmark SCOP (same family)
  - benchmark GOterms (homologue if one functional annotation with suitable
    evidence agrees)
  - benchmark Pfam (same family)
  - weighting function
* draw ROC curves

Maybe

* quality check of benchmark (GOTerms) on random proteins

=== Report ===

* Questions pfam
* Questions GOTerms
* Questions SCOP
* Questions BLAST

=Discussion=
* Rationale about benchmark (SCOP, GOTerms, Pfam, combination)
* Rationale about BLAST
* Discussion about results
